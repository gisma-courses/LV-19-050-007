## Assesment 

Let us assume that the  given research question is something like:

_**"Derivation of non-correlated forest parameters from LiDAR data for use in machine learning modeling"**_


  * Read the ressources related to forest and summarise at one article
  * Decide which algorithms and indices are adequate to answer the research question
  * Apply and document this findings with the help of the scripts you find in the given experiences of this unit.
  
  Please follow the instructions which will find under the section reproducible research. You will find templates instructions and schemes which may help you to produce your deliverables in a convienient way.
