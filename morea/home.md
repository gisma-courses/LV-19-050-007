## Welcome to LV-19-d19-006 - GIS, Winter 2021



The Geoinformation Systems course is a full term overview of selected topics in advanced GIS analysis as reproducible research workflows, based on R and Open Source Software and a full integration of GitHub. 

## Who should take this course

  This course is intended for the master level in Geography who have a working knowledge of at least the basic organisation of there operating system.

## Didactical concept

LV-19-d19-006 is structured as a sequential but not necessary linear series of [modules](/LV-19-d19-006/modules), each taking approximately two weeks to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Prerequisites](/LV-19-d19-006/prerequisites), describing skills you should have prior to starting the module.
  * [Learning Outcomes](/LV-19-d19-006//outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings & Resources](/LV-19-d19-006/LV-19-d19-006/readings), providing background material.
  * [Experiences](/LV-19-d19-006/experiences), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/LV-19-d19-006/assessments), which help you and your instructor to determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

## About the instructor

[Chris Reudenbach](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb19/fachbereich/staff/reudenbach) is head of the GI and Environmental Modeling Laboratory in the Department of Geography at the University of Marburg.

His research interests are the development of application-oriented algorithms and workflows in geoinformatics.  Besides (micro-)remote sensing and the modeling of dynamic, agent-based and environmental systems, the development of competence-centered teaching concepts in GI science is a major interest.
