# What do we mean when we talk about ethics?

Reproducible research is indispensable for credible and robust science. Especially in recent years, this self-image has come under increasing pressure. Against the backdrop of an increasing credibility crisis, the need to make research transparent and comprehensible from data collection to the interpretation of results and, above all, to share it has grown enormously.

The additional challenges for researchers are evident. Data, workflows and results must be usable across space and operating systems as easily as possible. This module presents central tools for transparent, reproducible and documented research.


<!---
Here’s a rather benign but illustrative example. On June 9, 2011, Google released a
“doodle” honoring Les Paul which users found addictive to play with. This is a type of
project that’s typically done by an individual engineer on their “20% time” in a day or
two. A third party, RescueTime, estimated that 5.3 million hours were spent playing this
game. Let us pause to consider that 5.3 million hours equates to about eight lifetimes.
Did the doodle make a positive contribution to the world? Do engineers at Google have
an obligation to consider this question before releasing the feature? What principle(s)
should they use to determine the answer? These are all valid questions, but what is
perhaps even more interesting here is the disproportionality between the amount of time
engineers spent creating the feature (at most a few person-days, in all likelihood), and the
amount of time users spent on it (several lifetimes).
