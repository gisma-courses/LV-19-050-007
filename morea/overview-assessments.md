This page collects together all of the **_assessments_** associated with individual modules.   

In this site, assessments represent the **_results_** of performing assessment activities, **not** the assessments themselves.  Because usually, you don't want to publish the actual assessment instruments on the course website!

Why the results? Publishing assessment results enable students to see how well they did compared to others. It also allows the instructor to provide feedback about learning activities.
